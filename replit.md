## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with JSON responses
- **Middleware**: Express middleware for request logging and error handling

### Development Environment
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared types and schemas between client and server
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server with Express backend integration
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Enabled for rapid development

## Key Components

### Database Schema (shared/schema.ts)
- **Users**: User authentication and management
- **Inquiries**: Student/parent inquiry storage with language detection
- **Responses**: AI-generated responses with status tracking
- **Templates**: Reusable response templates with usage analytics
- **Activities**: System activity logging for audit trails

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard Stats**: Real-time analytics display
- **Inquiry Form**: Input interface for new inquiries
- **Generated Response**: Response editing and management
- **Language Stats**: Multi-language communication analytics
- **Quick Templates**: Template management and usage
- **Response History**: Historical response tracking

### Backend Services
- **OpenAI Integration**: AI-powered response generation and language detection
- **Storage Layer**: Database abstraction for CRUD operations
- **Route Handlers**: RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication

## Data Flow

1. **Inquiry Processing**: Teachers input inquiries through the form component
2. **Language Detection**: OpenAI service detects the language of incoming inquiries
3. **Response Generation**: AI generates contextual responses based on inquiry type and content
4. **Response Management**: Teachers can edit, translate, and send generated responses
5. **Analytics Tracking**: System logs activities and generates dashboard statistics
6. **Template Management**: Frequently used responses can be saved as reusable templates

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, React Hook Form
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for response generation and language processing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS processing

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with React plugin
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across the stack
- **Code Quality**: ESBuild for production builds
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer plugin for Replit development environment

### Notable Libraries
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for timestamp formatting
- **Icon System**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React application to `dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database Migrations**: Drizzle kit handles schema migrations
4. **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL and OPENAI_API_KEY required

### Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend servers
- **Database Management**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` validates TypeScript across the project

### Configuration Management
- **Database Configuration**: Drizzle config points to shared schema
- **Vite Configuration**: Aliases for clean imports and Replit integration
- **Tailwind Configuration**: Custom color system and component styling
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Monorepo setup with path mapping

The architecture prioritizes developer experience with hot reloading, type safety, and modular component design while maintaining production readiness with optimized builds and proper error handling.
